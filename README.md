The commands involve computing and visualizing the Bessel function of the first kind, \( J_0(x) \). The first command calculates a power series expansion around \( x = 0 \) up to the \( x^{50} \) term, providing a polynomial approximation. The second command does similarly but up to the \( x^{45} \) term and converts the series into a regular polynomial. The third command plots this polynomial approximation over the interval \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 10 \), allowing for the visualization of the function's behavior within this range.
